    Reminders for Next Competiton or the Future
        - need to replace the string before millilani
        - need to bring extra string
        - need to figure out how to do wireless programming
        - remeber to tape the phone holder


    Programming Issues:
        - The gradle had not finished updating. Solved the issue by using a wifi hotspot from a phone
 and finishing the download

    Match Overview
    1] phone disconnected b/c the usb cable was not taped down and thw cord is loose. We should try to
    update code wirelessly to reduce ware and tare on the cord and the port

    2]the claw was having trouble gripping the cubes b/c the rubber band was not placed low enough.
    Additionally, the claw was not parrallel. TO solve this issue, the

    3] alliance member's arm slammed into us and dislocated the cord that goes into the main expansion hub

    4] Managed to stack a tower of 2 stones and almost got the cap stone. Human player ended up placing
    stone diagonalu and gaining penality

    5] Lost: Alliance recived two minor penalties. One for a late auto and one for flicking a cube.
    We were able to move 5 blocks, place 3, and make no sky scrapers.
